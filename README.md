# messenjer

A simple messenging app to demonstrate building an app with Clojure, ClojureScript, Kafka, Re-Frame, Pedestal, and Component.

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To start the back-end server you will need to open a REPL either from the command line:

    lein repl
    
Or if you are using Emacs with [Cider](https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) you can run the command to start the Cider REPL:

    C-c M-j
    
I haven't used [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/), but I hear it is really nice and I'm sure there's an easy way to start a REPL within it.
    
Once you have a REPL you can 

    (def system-map (com.stuartsierra.component/start (messenjer.system/system :dev)))
